##  Abstract
### This repository contains the code implementation for "Feature Independent Filter Pruning by Successive Layers Analysis" (FPSL). The work presents a novel approach to filter pruning in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by analyzing filters at each layer in a feature-independent manner. This method results in a computationally efficient pruning process while maintaining the modelâ€™s accuracy.
